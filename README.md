## Goals
1. To have the submarine in game connect to the flight simulator correctly.
2. To have an interesting story that allows players to become invested in the game.
3. To have abilities for both players to control that will affect how the game plays (Sonar, Flares, Etc.).
4. To have an enemy that correctly locks onto and attacks the player submarine if found. 
5. To have the atmosphere of the video game be frightening through sound and visual cues.
